# 11th Nov
Got a bare bones project up on GitHub.

# 1st December
Implemented a build script that will make it easier to build the components on the fly and eventually test them
automatically. This work was lost due to a rogue rm -R ./*.

# 2nd December
Reimplemented all the work done on the 1st. Looking at adding a document generator to the project.
